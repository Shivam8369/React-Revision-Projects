1. What is the significance of React Fragments?

    React Fragments are used to group multiple elements together without adding an extra DOM node. They are useful when you need to return multiple elements from a component, but don't want to wrap them in an unnecessary div element.

2. What are React Hooks?

    React Hooks are a way to use state and other React features in functional components. They provide a way to "hook into" React state and lifecycle methods from functional components.

3. Explain the useEffect Hook.

    The useEffect hook is used to handle side effects in functional components, such as making API calls or setting timers. It takes a function as an argument, which is called after the component has rendered.

4. What is the purpose of the useState Hook?

    The useState hook is used to add state to functional components. It takes an initial value as an argument and returns an array with the current state value and a function to update it.

5. What is the significance of keys in React lists?

    Keys are used to identify elements in a list and help React keep track of changes to the list. They should be unique and stable, and are used to optimize rendering and improve performance.

6. What is the Context API in React?

    The Context API is a way to share data between components without passing props down manually. It provides a way to create a global state that can be accessed by any component in the application.

7. How does React handle prop drilling, and whatâ€™s the solution?

    Prop drilling is the process of passing props down from a parent component to a child component, often through multiple levels of nesting. The solution is to use the Context API or a state management library like Redux.


8. What is Redux, and why might you use it with React?

    Redux is a state management library that helps manage global state by providing a single source of truth for the application's state. It's often used with React to manage complex state and side effects.

9. What is the significance of PureComponent in React?

    PureComponent is a class component that implements the shouldComponentUpdate method, which checks if the component's props or state have changed before re-rendering. This can improve performance by reducing unnecessary re-renders. {deprecated}

10. Explain React Router.

    React Router is a popular library for client-side routing in React applications. It provides a way to navigate between pages and manage the application's URL.

11. What is the significance of the memo function in React?

    The memo function is used to memoize a component, which means caching its output to improve performance. It's often used to optimize functional components that don't rely on props or state.

12. What is the purpose of the useReducer Hook?

    The useReducer hook is used to manage state with a reducer function, similar to Redux. It's often used to manage complex state and side effects in functional components.

13. Explain the concept of higher-order components (HOCs) in React.

    HOCs are functions that take a component as an argument and return a new component with additional props or behavior. They're often used to share functionality between components.

14. What is the role of the key attribute in React?
    refer question 5

15. How does React handle forms?
    React handles forms by providing a way to manage form state and handle form submissions. It's often used with controlled components, which are form elements that have their value controlled by the component's state.


16. Explain the concept of server-side rendering (SSR) in React.
